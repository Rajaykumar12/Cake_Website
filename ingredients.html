            <ul id="main2">Vanilla Cake
                <ul id="main3">To make a simple vanilla cake, you will need 1 1/2 cups of all-purpose flour, 1 1/2 teaspoons of baking powder,
                     and a pinch of salt for the dry ingredients. For the wet ingredients, use 1/2 cup of softened unsalted butter, 1 cup of granulated sugar,
                      and 2 large eggs. Add 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract for flavor, and finally, mix in 1/2 cup of milk to bring it all together.
                       This combination will give you a soft, fluffy cake that's perfect on its own or with your favorite frosting!

            <ul id="main2">Cake SLices
                <ul id="main3">
                    To make a refreshing ice cream slice with a random flavor of your choice, 
                    start by selecting 2 cups of your favorite flavored ice cream (chocolate, vanilla, strawberry, or any unique flavor).
                    Soften the ice cream slightly at room temperature. For the base, crush 1 1/2 cups of graham crackers or digestive biscuits,
                    then mix them with 1/4 cup of melted butter to form a crust. Press this mixture firmly into the bottom of a lined loaf pan.
                    Spread the softened ice cream evenly over the crust, smoothing the top. Cover the pan with plastic wrap and freeze for at least 4 hours, 
                    or until firm. Once frozen, slice and serve your delightful ice cream treat, optionally garnished with chocolate sauce, fresh fruit, or sprinkles for extra flair!

            <ul id="main2">Chocolate Cake
                <ul id="main3">
                    To make a delicious chocolate cake, you’ll need 1 and 3/4 cups of all-purpose flour, 3/4 cup of unsweetened cocoa powder, 1 and 1/2 teaspoons of baking powder, 
                    1 and 1/2 teaspoons of baking soda, and 1 teaspoon of salt. In a separate bowl, mix 2 cups of granulated sugar with 1/2 cup of vegetable oil, 2 large eggs, 
                    and 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract. Add 1 cup of buttermilk and 1 cup of hot water or coffee (for richer flavor) to the wet ingredients, then gradually combine with the dry mixture. 
                    Pour the batter into greased cake pans and bake at 350°F (175°C) for 30-35 minutes. Let the cake cool before adding your favorite frosting. Enjoy the rich, moist, chocolatey goodness!

            <ul id="main2">Red Velvet Cake
                <ul id="main3">
                    To make a classic red velvet cake, you’ll need 2 and 1/2 cups of all-purpose flour, 2 tablespoons of unsweetened cocoa powder, 
                    1 teaspoon of baking soda, and 1/2 teaspoon of salt for the dry ingredients. In another bowl, whisk together 1 and 1/2 cups of granulated sugar, 
                    1 cup of vegetable oil, and 2 large eggs. Add 1 cup of buttermilk, 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract, and 1 tablespoon of white vinegar. 
                    For that signature red color, stir in 2 tablespoons of red food coloring (gel works best). Gradually mix the wet ingredients into the dry mixture.
                    Once combined, pour the batter into greased cake pans and bake at 350°F (175°C) for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean. 
                    Let the cake cool before frosting with a rich cream cheese frosting, which perfectly complements the slight cocoa flavor and soft texture of the red velvet cake.
